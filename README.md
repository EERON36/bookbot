# BookBot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

## What it does

- Reads a book text file (currently `books/frankenstein.txt`)
- Counts the total number of words
- Counts how many times each character appears
- Prints a formatted report of the most common letters

## How to run

```bash
python3 main.py
